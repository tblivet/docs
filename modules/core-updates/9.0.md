# Notable changes in PrestaShop 9.0

This section provides a list of the most significant changes in PrestaShop 9.0. While this list is not exhaustive, it aims to give developers a clear overview of the important updates. If you notice any missing or incorrect information, please help us improve by creating an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/issues/new).

## PHP support

PrestaShop 9.0 now requires **PHP 8.1 minimum**, with support added for PHP 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4.

- [Remove compatibility for PHP versions inferior to PHP 8.1](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32514)
- [Support for PHP 8.2](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/29116)
- [Support for PHP 8.3](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34485)
- [Support for PHP 8.4](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/37417)

## Node support

The **minimum** version to build PrestaShop assets is now the version 20.

## Core changes

### Symfony Upgrade

PrestaShop 9.0 has been upgraded to rely on Symfony 6.4. This is a significant leap from the previous version, 8.x, which was based on Symfony 4.4. As a result, version 9 includes all the breaking changes related to the Symfony Framework. For more details about these changes in the core, you can refer to the [PrestaShop GitHub issue](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/33993). Additionally, you can consult the Symfony migration guides (see links below).

Symfony 6.4 is the latest LTS version and will receive bug fixes until November 2026, as well as security fixes until November 2027.

### Removed dependencies

We have followed Symfony's recommendations and made changes to our dependencies. Instead of using the `symfony/symfony` dependency, we now manually include each sub-package. Additionally, due to the minimum PHP version requirement of 8.1, we had to upgrade or remove certain dependencies.

During this process, we took the opportunity to clean up dependencies that are no longer used in the core, regardless of whether they are from Symfony or not. If you rely on these dependencies in your modules, you will need to integrate them into your module's dependencies.

| Library name                       | Reason for removal/Replacement                              |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| guzzlehttp/guzzle                  | Replaced by Symfony HTTP client in the core                 |
| league/tactician-bundle            | Replaced by Symfony Messenger component                     |
| pear/archive_tar                   | No longer used                                              |
| sensio/framework-extra-bundle      | We now favor annotations in the core                        |
| soundasleep/html2text              | No longer used                                              |
| swiftmailer/swiftmailer            | Replaced by Symfony Mailer component in the core            |
| symfony/inflector                  | No longer used                                              |
| symfony/notifier                   | No longer used                                              |
| symfony/rate-limiter               | No longer used                                              |
| symfony/semaphore                  | No longer used                                              |
| symfony/uid                        | No longer used                                              |
| symfony/workflow                   | No longer used                                              |

#### Mailer Migration

We have migrated from Swift Mailer to Symfony Mailer. This change includes several improvements and aligns with Symfony's latest recommendations.

**Mail SSL encryption was dropped**

When we migrated from Swift Mailer to Symfony Mailer, we noticed that SSL support was not an option in ESMTP transport. SSL is an old and outdated encryption type, and for security reasons, it will no longer be allowed.

The remaining choices are "TLS encryption" or "No encryption".

### Symfony controllers

In Symfony 6.4, the controllers must now be defined as services. The impact on the existing controllers is mainly around the concept of Dependency Injection and how services are injected or accessed in the controllers.
The container passed to the controllers is no longer the "global container" that contains all the existing services in the application. Instead, it injects a dedicated container optimized for the controller based on the services that are injected into it.

The issue is that most of PrestaShop's Symfony controllers do not rely on injection but instead use the `$this->get('service_name')` method to access any service. This is no longer possible in modern controllers because of the mentioned optimization related to container build (and the `get` method was even removed).
To avoid a very big breaking change, we modified the `PrestaShopBundle\Controller\Admin\FrameworkBundleAdminController`, so that it can fetch services from the controller's container **and** from the global one, but this is a little hack that goes against Symfony recommendations, as such this base class is already **deprecated and will be removed in PrestaShop 10.0**.

This gives developers some time to refacto their controllers. They should now rely on the new `PrestaShopBundle\Controller\Admin\PrestaShopAdminController`, which doesn't implement the mentioned hack in order to force a proper implementation of the controllers.
You can read more details about <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/6.4/controller/service.html" target="_blank">Controllers as services</a>, <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/6.4/service_container/service_subscribers_locators.html" target="_blank">Service Subscribers & Locators</a> or <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/6.4/service_container.html">Service container</a> in general.

As an example, you have three main possibilities to inject a service into your controller:

```php
<?php

use PrestaShopBundle\Controller\Admin\PrestaShopAdminController;

class MyController extends PrestaShopAdminController
{
    /**
     * You can inject your service systematically in the constructor, useful if the service is used by several actions of your controller.
     * 
     * @param MyCustomService $myCustomService
     */
    public function __construct(
      private readonly MyCustomService $myCustomService,
    ) {
    }
    
    /**
     * You can inject a service only on one method, useful if the service is used only in one action. It is more optimized than injecting it all the time and never using it.
     * 
     * @param MySpecificService $specificService
     * @return JsonResponse
     */
    public function indexAction(MySpecificService $specificService): JsonResponse
    {
        $generalData = $this->myCustomerService->getData();
        $specificData = $specifiService->getSpecificData();

        // You can use the get method to fetch a service that was added in the getSubscribedServices method
        $toolingService = $this->container->get(ToolingService::class);
        
        return new JsonResponse($toolingService->format($generalData + $specificData));
    }
    
    /**
     * You can define a list of registered services, they will be accessible via the $this->container->get method, this
     * way of injecting service is interesting if implemented on a base controller class for generic services that
     * may be used by many controllers (like the router, the translator, ...) so you don't need to inject them manually
     * in each controller class.
     * 
     * @return array
     */
    public static function getSubscribedServices(): array
    {
        return parent::getSubscribedServices() + [
            ToolingService::class => ToolingService::class,
        ];
    }
}
```

**Define your controller as a service**

You can already anticipate and define your controllers as services, it is also compatible with previous versions of Symfony and PrestaShop:

```yaml
services:
  MyNamespace\MyController:
    # Using autowire will inject services in the constructors automatically
    autowire: true
    # Using autoconfigure with controllers that extend AbstractController will handle method parameter injection and subscribed services
    autoconfigure: true
    # If your controller class doesn't extend AbstractController you should add this tag manually so you benefit from method parameters injection
    tags: ['controller.service_arguments']
```

{{% notice note %}}
**PrestaShopAdminController::getSubscribedServices**

The new base controller class uses the `getSubscribedServices` method to give easy access to some commonly used PrestaShop services, like the `ConfigurationInterface`, `HookDispatcherInterface`, `TranslatorInterface`, ...
You can see the <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/9.0.0-alpha.1/src/PrestaShopBundle/Controller/Admin/PrestaShopAdminController.php#L59" target="_blank">full list of subscribed services</a> in the class, this list will probably grow piece by piece but only for common generic services.
<br/><br/>
Thanks to this, you can use `$this->container->get(ConfigurationInterface::class)->get('my_config')` to access the configuration service, or alternatively use the helper method `$this->getConfiguration()->get('my_config')`.
The `PrestaShopAdminController` class comes with other helpful helper methods that are commonly used in controllers.

### Kernel modifications

Until PrestaShop 8, we relied on one Kernel used for the back office. In PrestaShop 9.0, we expanded the usage of the Symfony framework, especially for two new features:
- [the new Admin API based on API Platform](https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2024/meet-prestashop9-api/) and OAuth authentication
- an experimental feature that gives access to a Symfony container in the front office (in opposition to the custom-built container available today). This one is not very much used yet, but it's a first stone for the future front office migration

Those two new environments have mechanisms and configuration different from those in the back office. To separate these configurations cleanly, they each have their dedicated kernel class and their own configuration. This allows to cleanly define different routing, security configurations, dedicated services, listeners, etc.

Each kernel has a unique `applicationId` that allows to dynamize its configuration and cache folder (since the services are not the same, each kernel needs its own cache folder). The `appId` parameter has also been added globally to the `bin/console` tool. They all share the common `app/config/config.yml` configuration file, but each one extends it in its own config folder.

| Environment                 | Kernel class     | Config folder          | Cache folder                          | Endpoint               | App ID |
|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Back office                 | `AdminKernel`    | `app/config/admin`     | `var/cache/{dev,prod,test}/admin`     | `/admin-dev/index.php` | `admin`        |
| Admin API                   | `AdminAPIKernel` | `app/config/admin-api` | `var/cache/{dev,prod,test}/admin-api` | `/admin-api/index.php` | `admin-api`    |
| Front office (experimental) | `FrontKernel`    | `app/config/front`     | `var/cache/{dev,prod,test}/front`     | `/index.php`           | `front`        |

{{% notice note %}}
**Console usage examples**

To clear the cache of the Admin API for its `prod` environment:

`php bin/console cache:clear --env=prod --app-id=admin-api`

--

To display event listeners for the back office in `dev` environment (default value of `app-id` is `admin` for retro compatibility):
`php bin/console debug:event-dispatcher kernel.request --env=dev`

### Symfony layout

All the back office pages share a common layout, composed of a few elements:
- the `<head>` element that includes all the CSS and JS (among other things)
- the side navigation menu
- the header of the page which is itself composed of:
  - quick access component
  - search form
  - notifications center
  - employee dropdown
  - the multistore header (when multistore is enabled)
  - the page toolbar (which includes breadcrumbs and top action buttons)
- the footer (which only contains a `displayBackOfficeFooter` display hook)

Until PrestaShop 8.1, all these common elements were handled by legacy code, so even on the migrated pages, there was always a background legacy controller based on `AdminController` in charge of building the layout data and rendering it. Once the layout was rendered the central content of Symfony pages was included in the middle of it. It means no page was completely free from the legacy controllers, which would ultimately block the end of migration, while they are intended to disappear completely.

In PrestaShop 9.0 all this layout part is now fully handled by Symfony, we use <a href="https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-twig-component/current/index.html" target="_blank">Twig components</a> to render each element independently. The code is, therefore, easier to understand, a component class is responsible for fetching/building the data, while the actual rendering is based on Twig. See our <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/develop/src/PrestaShopBundle/Twig/Component" target="_blank">Layout components</a> for more details.

On legacy pages, we follow the same principle. Symfony is now in charge of rendering all the layout, and we use some <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/develop/src/PrestaShopBundle/Twig/Component/Legacy" target="_blank">Legacy layout components</a> that follow the same architecture, but render different Twig templates to fit with the old **default theme** (that is based on old Bootstrap and includes old legacy helpers like `HelperForm` and `HelperList`).

**What changes for my module pages?**

We refactored this layout with maximum backward compatibility in mind. The HTML layout itself had minimum changes (in both migrated and legacy pages). We tried to keep the same hooks in both the PHP code and the Twig templates. We even introduced a fake legacy controller in migrated pages that has no logic but is kept mostly as a [DTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object) to contain things like CSS files and JS files, because that's where most modules add their content.

We still had to change the controller workflow. Many of the functions in `AdminController` are no longer useful as they are used to initialize the layout variables (now handled by Twig components). Some methods also render or write output directly, which we prevent as we need to get the rendered content as a string to integrate it correctly inside the new layout. This means some internal methods had to be split to avoid unwanted usage.

**Legacy workflow:**

Here you'll find the [execution workflow of legacy controllers]({{< relref "9/development/architecture/legacy/legacy-controllers.md" >}})

**Symfony workflow:**

<div class="mermaid">
  flowchart TD
  A[Special Routing Matching URL] -->|Check URL with LegacyRouterChecker::check| B{Is valid?}
  B -->|Yes| C[Instantiate Controller & call AdminController::init]
  B -->|No| Z[Invalid URL]
  C --> D[Set attributes on Symfony Request]
  D --> E[LegacyController::legacyPageAction]
  E --> F[LegacyController::initController]
  F --> G[Check permissions based on detected controller & action]
  G --> H[SmartyVariablesFiller::fillDefault]
  H --> I[AdminController::setMedia]
  I --> J[AdminController::postProcess]
  J -->|redirect_after defined| K[Perform HTTP redirection]
  J -->|redirect_after not defined| L{ajax query parameter defined?}
  L -->|Yes| M[LegacyController::renderAjaxController]
  L -->|No| N[LegacyController::renderPageContent]
  M --> O[Execute AdminController::initContent]
  O --> P[Execute AdminController::displayAjax]
  P --> Q[Catch output data & return as response]
  N --> R[Execute AdminController::initContent]
  R --> S[Fetch AdminController::template content]
  S --> T[Call Cookie::write]
  T --> U[Get modal content via AdminController::renderModal]
</div>

The two workflows should render the same result. Many methods from the legacy workflow are not executed anymore because they lost their purpose, but in case you override one of those methods, be aware that they are no longer called directly, so there are breaking changes:

- `AdminController:run`
- `AdminController::initHeader`
- `AdminController::initContent`
- `AdminController::initFooter`
- `AdminController:display`

Also, be aware that many Smarty variables are no longer defined because they were only used to render the layout.

Despite the changes in the workflow and the fact we no longer depend on the `Dispatcher` class, we **maintained** these hooks:
- `actionDispatcher`
- `actionDispatcherBefore`
- `actionDispatcherAfter`

### Back office login and authorization migrated to Symfony

The back office login page has been migrated to Symfony. Along with this change, the authorization system in the back office is now also based on Symfony, which implies several things:
- we no longer depend on the legacy `Context::$cookie`, the session is kept on the server side, and very few data are kept on the browser side. For retro-compatibility, we still populate the legacy cookie so that you can **read** it. While you can use `Context::$cookie` for your custom data, making changes to the data previously used for PrestaShop authorization will no longer have the desired effect and may even result in instability, so it's not recommended
- the `PrestaShopBundle\Security\Admin\EmployeeProvider` and `PrestaShopBundle\Service\DataProvider\UserProvider` now return a `PrestaShopBundle\Entity\Employee` instance, their responsibility is to return a `Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserInterface` anyway (and they still do) but in case you depended on the child class know that `PrestaShopBundle\Security\Admin\Employee` no longer exist
- if you need to get the logged-in user, you can use the Symfony `Symfony\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Security` service, but we recommend you use the `EmployeeContext` internal PrestaShop service (see explanation about [new Contexts]({{< relref "9/modules/core-updates/9.0.md#symfony-context-refacto" >}}))

**Storing custom data in a Session**

If you need to persist some custom Employee data, we no longer recommend using the `Context::$cookie`. Instead, you can use the `Session` from Symfony and update its attributes:

```php
// In Symfony controllers, you can get the session from the Request parameter injected by Symfony
$session = $request->getSession();

// In other services you will need to get the current request via the RequestStack service
$request = $requestStack->getCurrentRequest();
if ($request) {
  $session = $request->getSession();
}

// You can then get/set a custom attribute, but you should always check that the session object is indeed available.
// Some requests do not rely on the session, and it may never be created
if ($session) {
  // Be careful to use a custom and UNIQUE attribute name
  $myData = $session->getAttribute('my_custom_data');
  
  // The session object will be automatically serialized at the end of the request,
  // and automatically unserialized at the beginning of the next requests
  $session->setAttribute('my_custom_data', 'updated value');
}
```

{{% notice note %}}
The Symfony Session has other useful features, such as flash bags for storing temporary data. You can find more information about its usage in the <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/6.4/session.html" target="_blank">Session documentation</a>.

**Removed hooks:**
- `actionAdminLoginControllerBefore`
- `actionAdminLoginControllerLoginBefore`
- `actionAdminLoginControllerLoginAfter`
- `actionAdminLoginControllerForgotBefore`
- `actionAdminLoginControllerForgotAfter`
- `actionAdminLoginControllerResetBefore`
- `actionAdminLoginControllerResetAfter`

**Hooks kept for backward compatibility:**
- `actionAdminLoginControllerSetMedia` so you can add some custom assets on the login page
- `displayAdminLogin` so you can add custom HTML on the login page

**New hooks**
- `actionBackOfficeLoginForm` to modify the login form (the form builder is passed via the `form_builder` hook parameter)
- `actionEmployeeRequestPasswordResetForm` to modify the request password form (the form builder is passed via the `form_builder` hook parameter)

The login logic, however, is not handled by PrestaShop's internal code so there is no handler that interprets the submitted data (and that's why there are so few new hooks). Instead we rely on <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/security.html#form-login" target="_blank">Symfony form login authentication system</a>, so it's Symfony's internal system that interprets the data submitted, validates it and authenticate the employee to the back office.

If you need to integrate your code with the authentication process you should now rely on the <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/security.html#authentication-events" target="_blank">Authentication events</a> described in their documentation, you can also inspire yourself from our <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/develop/src/PrestaShopBundle/EventListener/Admin/EmployeeSessionSubscriber.php" target="_blank">internal subscriber</a>.

### Symfony context refactorization

A significant amount of code in the core relies on the legacy `Context` class, which stores certain data as a singleton. However, this legacy implementation has many drawbacks, so refactoring was initiated in PrestaShop 9.0 to replace its usage.

You can find more details about the reason behind this and the implementation in the related <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/ADR/blob/master/0024-context-refacto.md" traget="_blank">ADR about Context refactoring</a>.

You should now favor using the modern split context services:

- `PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Context\ApiClientContext`
- `PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Context\CountryContext`
- `PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Context\CurrencyContext`
- `PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Context\EmployeeContext`
- `PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Context\LanguageContext`
- `PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Context\LegacyControllerContext`
- `PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Context\ShopContext`

We still have some work to do to replace all the usages of the legacy context with the modern ones, but the new code will stop using the legacy ones. We recommend that developers rely on the new ones from now on.

- [LegacyControllerContext](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34390)

## Migrated pages

The migration of back office pages to Symfony imply several breaking changes, we won't detail all of them for each page but here is a summary:
- the legacy URL is no longer reachable, you are automatically redirected to the migrated page
- the legacy controller is removed along with its associated Smarty templates
- the legacy hooks related to controller workflow are no longer called
- the page no longer uses Smarty, but Twig
- the page no longer uses HelperForm and HelperList, but Symfony form components and Grid components

Here is the list of migrated pages in v9:

- International > Locations > States
- Shop parameters > Order settings > Statuses
- Orders > Shopping Carts
- Sell > Catalog > Attributes & Features -> Attributes
- Sell > Catalog >  Attributes & Features -> Feature
- Sell > Catalog > Products (new version of the page introduce in PrestaShop 8.1 is now the only available one)

### Changes in the product page

Edition of features on the new product page, [use a new optimized data structure in the form](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34763). You may need to adapt your module if you rely on the old structure.

## Breaking Changes

### `trans` method

Following [PrestaShop/PrestaShop#30415](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/30415), the function `trans()` does **not** escape anymore strings. In PrestaShop 8, you could pass parameters like `htmspecialcharacters` or `addslashes` to `trans()` to perform additional escape, but itâ€™s been removed. It also affects the `l` function in Smarty.

Since [PrestaShop/PrestaShop#31900](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31900), the `trans` method always keep the behavior it had with the (now removed) `_raw` parameter, meaning the content is not modified anymore. You need to use `htmlspecialchars` on your parameters provided on input and on the returned string if you need to modify it.

### Some front controller now use `Presenter` classes

This changes the data passed to the Smarty templates:

| Page                                                | Details                                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Rebranding changes

- [Breaking changes in the PrestaShop Back Office due to rebranding](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/36584)
  - **New Fonts**: The adoption of `IBM Plex Sans` and `Material Symbols` is part of the rebranding effort. These fonts are included in both the `default` theme and also the `new-theme` through the UI Kit.
  - **Removal of `postcss.config.js`**: The `postcss.config.js` file, which used the deprecated `postcss-cssnext` package, has been removed. This package is no longer needed.
  - **Removal of SCSS Files**: The file `admin-dev/themes/default/scss/modules/_colors.scss` and the directory `admin-dev/themes/default/scss/modules/colors/` have been removed. These are no longer used in the back office. Update your stylesheets to avoid relying on these outdated resources.

## Back office rebranding

By the end of 2023, PrestaShop introduced a new brand identity to reinforce its strengths and enhance credibility and trust. The PrestaShop back office was one of the final components to undergo rebranding, with the release of PrestaShop 9 providing an ideal opportunity for this update.

### Anatomy of PrestaShop back office

The PrestaShop back office consists of [two themes][bo-themes]. Both themes have been modified to achieve a complete rebranding:

#### Theme: default
- Used for legacy controllers
- Based on **Bootstrap 3**
- Now includes `_root.scss` file from the **PrestaShop UI Kit** to expose CSS variables from the UI Kit


#### Theme: new-theme
- Used for Symfony controllers
- Based on **Bootstrap 4**
- Utilizes the **PrestaShop UI Kit**

[bo-themes]: {{< ref "/9/development/architecture/introduction.md#bo-themes" >}}
